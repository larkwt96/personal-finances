# BRRRR Method


Buy
  - look for areas with renovations
  - don't get too high end because those tenants can just buy a house
  - Just below average is a good price range
  - 2-4 units and 2+ bd, 2+ ba
  - Condos? Too restrictive and HOA fee
  - buy for undervalue
  - to learn value, go to every house
  - Learn rent range
