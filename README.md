# Everything I Know About Finances

Somehow money is made, and this is called income. There are costs to living, and these are called expenses. You control many aspects of what income and expenses you have, but the goal is to maximize how much you save. With this extra money, you can create more income. Eventually, you have 

Keep your extra money in high interest accounts. It's possible to get a high interest [savings account](#guide-to-checking-and-savings) (e.g. with Ally Bank). This keeps your money saver from inflation. Then you can pay down [loans or invest](#guide-to-investing) in the retirement fund or taxed stock accounts (e.g. with Vanguard). You should track your [accounts](#basic-flow) and set a budget (e.g. with Mint). Use [credit cards](#guide-to-credit-cards) to make daily purchases to build credit and earn rewards with every purchase. Pay them off in full with your checking account (auto payments are nice). 

Depending on your income and expenses, you'll eventually have enough to live off your retirement fund alone. The general rule is have 25 times what you want your salary to be. That's because you will pull out 4% of your retirement assets every year, and they will grow back by the end. There are ways of getting retirement funds out before 59.5 if you can retire early.

## Types of Income and Expenses

These are the ways you can get and spend money.

* Income (+)
  * Paycheck / Salary 
  * Windfall (lottery, inheritance)
  * Assets (property, company, investments)
* Expenses (-)
  * Rent / Mortgage
  * Auto loan
  * Student loans
  * Credit card loans
  * Personal loans
  * Large purchases (trips, computers)
  * Kids

## Accounts

These are the places to store your money. Some earn you more money than others.

* Checking account
* Savings account
* Credit cards
* Stock accounts
  * Roth IRA
  * 401k
  * ETFs / Index Funds

## Basic Flow

Money originates from your income. It flows into your checking account. From there, expenses are paid. Extra funds are moved to your savings. When your savings account large enough, extra funds are moved to investments such as your retirement fund (Roth IRA, 401k) and finally ETFs or index funds or loans.

The flow of money will transfer between these accounts. When one is full, it moves to the next account. Savings have a self imposed cap, retirement funds have a cap, and stocks have no cap.

Part of your expenses is paying off loans, but if the interest rate of the market is greater than the interest rate of your loan, then it could be more beneficial to invest instead of paying off loans. See the Guide to Investing section.

Owning property or businesses can also be very profitable, but they take much more work and funding.

# Guide to Checking and Savings

## Emergency Fund

Calculate the average monthly expenditure (including yearly expenses divided by 12). It's best to keep 6-12 months worth of this amount in liquid assets. This helps withstand a loss of income for that period of time. Liquid assets are assets which can be turned into cash very easily, such as cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money markets. Stocks, CDs, cars, properties and bonds are not easily accessible assets, and that's why they don't make good emergency funds.

## Management

For example, 2 months worth can be kept in checking and 8 months worth in savings. The amount in your checking account will rise with your income and decrease with your expenses, so there will always be 1-2 months worth. There will always be a 1 month buffer to prevent overdraft, keep minimum balance, and keep immediately ready funds.

If the checking account goes over the 2 month amount, the extra money should go into your savings account. When your savings account reaches 8 months worth, the extra money should go towards retirement and stocks.

## Large Purchases

If you are saving for something (down payment on house, laptop, etc), keep the money in your savings to take advantage of higher interest rates, and move it to checking when you make the purchase. Also, try to make the purchase with a credit card if possible.

## Interest 

Get high yield savings accounts to maximize your interest. Currently, interest rates can be around 2% which can yield several hundred dollars per year.

I recommend Ally Bank
* High yield savings account 
* Free checking with high interest
* No minimum balance
* Free checks and debit cards
* ACH transfers are free

# Guide to Credit Cards

Credit cards do two things: build credit and give rewards for daily expenses. If paid in full each month, you'll never pay interest. For that reason, use the credit card for everything, and never use your debit card or cash.

Make sure
* the signing bonus and reward is good
* $0 annual fee (or convert it before it becomes costly)
* interest is only applied to unpaid principle (if paid in full, no interest is ever applied)

## Credit Score

I'm no expert, but here's what I do know. Basically read r/churning.

Multiple lines of credit are valued, and cards have signing bonuses. When your credit score is high enough from your first credit card to get good reward cards, apply for new credit cards, get the signing bonus, and then leave them open forever. If they aren't $0 annual fee cards, then convert them to fee less cards if you can. Repeat this 3 or 4 times (do more research if you want to continue doing this further).

* Good
  * Many lines of credit
  * Old lines of credit
* Bad
  * Missing payments
  * Lots credit inquiries
  * Closing credit lines

Opening too many accounts within a short period of time (2 months) can cause a lot of inquires and looks bad. However, 3-4 inquiries spaced out in a year is fine since they disappear quick.

Closing credit cards is bad too. Instead, you can try to downgrade the card to a $0 annual fee card. This keeps the credit line open and doesn't hurt you. However, closing the account doesn't influence your score after two years, so if you have to close a credit card account, don't apply for auto or mortgage loans within those two years. Don't close your oldest account.

## Rewards

I've noticed 4 types of cards, generally.
* 1.5% cash back
  * Good card to get first (or second after building credit) 
* 1% cash back but 2-3% cash back on food, gas, travel
  * Optimally, use this card only on the 2-3% cash back items, and the 1.% percent cash back on the rest.
* Reward miles
  * Good with frequent travel and if you care about the luxury benefits
  * Usually has annual fee but much higher rewards
* 5% cash back on food, gas, travel but during limited times
  * I'm pretty sure these are for families with high expenses

# Guide to Investing

By investing, I mean paying off loans, buying bonds, CDs, investing in stocks, investing in stocks through retirement funds, etc. There's also buying businesses and real estate, but that's not as easy.

Main tips:
* Pay monthly loans
* Prioritize high interest
  * Pay credit card loans immediately
  * Invest when market growth rates are higher than loan rates
* Prioritize retirement funds over general market investments since they are untaxed in several ways.
* Use Vanguard for stocks

## Compound Interest Explained

It's import to understand compound interest, and there's tons of guides online. What's important to understand is that the amount doesn't matter as much as the rate does.
* After enough time, $50 growing at 5% interest will be more than $5000 growing at 1% since it grows 5 times faster.
* The same is true for debt interests. Given two loans, $50 at 10% and $5000 at 5%, it's cheaper to pay off the $50 loan first since it's growing twice as fast.
* The same is true for mixed interest. Suppose you have a student loan debt growing at 5%, but investing in the market might yield 6%. It's financially optimal (ignoring risk) to invest in the market instead of paying down your loan with extra cash (you should always pay your monthly payment)
* Credit card rates are extremely high. It's a really bad idea to let these types of debts sit and should be made a priority to pay off.

## Extra Fund Allocation

Any time you have extra money, you have to consider where to put it.
* Savings account (2%)
  * Your emergency fund should live here. You can get high yield accounts that have interest rates of 2% while still being able to access the money.
* Loans (~ -5%)
  * Always make the monthly payments so that you stay on track to becoming debt free
  * Mortgages, auto and student loans have rates where it might be better to invest your extra money instead of paying down the loans. It's riskier due to market volatility, and it's generally bad to have debt, so weigh your options. 
  * Generally, you want to pay off car loans in 1-2 years, mortgages in 15-30 years, and student loans in 10 years.
* Credit card debt (~ -15%)
  * Pay your card in full.
  * If you really need to, open a new card with 0% apr for a year. Then, make a large purchase. This is a way to get a 0% interest rate loan.
* Retirement fund / Investments

## Investment Options (in order of priority)

* Accounts 
  * 401k Matching cap
  * Traditional / Roth IRA cap
  * The rest of your 401k cap
  * HSA account plays a role, but idk what. Get one from your employer
  * Taxable
* Investment Options: ETFs / Index Funds / Bonds (~7%)
  * There's management fees and gains are taxed
  * There's no limit and you can sell any time
  * You want some ratio of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. 70 / 20 / 10 might be good, but it also can vary with age and which account.
* Certificate of Deposit (2.5%)
  * You can't use the money you put in one of these. They are like short term investments, or bonds
  * If you have loans, you should just pay those off since the interest rates of loans are often higher than CDs
  * This is a good place to put money when you have a specific time you know you'll need it. For example, if you're saving up for something or if you're feeling risky with your emergency fund.

# All About Retirement

To maximize your money, you want to invest. When you get an income (usually from a job) it's taxed. Then, when you invest and your money grows, it's taxed again. Retirement funds are ways of avoiding or deferring the taxes.

* Roth IRA
  * Your income is taxed, but your profits are not
  * When you withdraw after 60, it's not taxed
  * You can also withdraw contributions before 60 untaxed
  * If you make over 122k, things change
* Traditional IRA
  * Contributions are not taxed
  * Profits are not taxed until withdrawal
  * you might not qualify for the deduction
* 401k
  * Contributions not taxed
  * Contributions can only come from job income
  * Employer may match
  * Withdrawals are taxed

## Tips

* Order of investing importance:
  * Employer Matching
  * IRA
  * 401k
  * taxed investments
* You can pull money out before 60 by building a Roth IRA ladder.
* There are caps to the amount you can invest, which is why you can't just invest when you're 35 and making much more. Also, the amount it could have grown in that 10 years is a lot (it could have doubled.)
* 4% rule: if you withdraw 4% of your retirement fund, you can earn it back by the end of the year. Therefore, to retire, you need 25 times the amount you plan to spend per year in your retirement fund. 30k per year needs 750k.

## 401k

### Contributing

This has to be setup with your employer because it gets siphoned out of your income before taxes. There is a percentage you can contribute up to 19,000. Your employer may also match part of this.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. These can have fees or not be as good as IRAs, so typically, they are not as good without an employer matching.

### Withdrawals

Because you haven't paid taxes on the money in this account, income tax will be applied when you withdraw from this account at any point. If you withdraw before 59.5, then there is additionally a 10% tax fee.

It also means if you continue working, you end up in a really high tax bracket, but at that point, you shouldn't be pulling money out because what do you even need it for?

### Rollovers

You can roll a 401k over into a traditional IRA without paying taxes. This is probably optimal after changing employers unless the new 401k is somehow better.

## Traditional IRA (or just IRA)

### Contributions

You can use contributions as a tax deduction. This is different from contributing before being taxed, but it's ultimately the same. However, the tax deductible isn't possible if you make too much: partially for 64k-74k per year and completely for 74k+. I think at that point, it's basically a Roth IRA or you should just invest in a Roth IRA. There is a $6,000 cap which is why it's important to invest early. Further, this cap is for all IRA accounts, so you can't cap an IRA and then go contribute to a Roth IRA.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. And you get to choose index funds / ETFs (US and international) and bonds, so it's better than a 401k where you might not get to choose.

### Withdrawals

Because you haven't paid taxes on the money in this account, income tax will be applied when you withdraw from this account at any point. If you withdraw before 59.5, then there is additionally a 10% tax fee.

It also means if you continue working, you end up in a really high tax bracket, but at that point, you shouldn't be pulling money out because what do you even need it for?

Yes this is the same as 401ks

### Rollovers

It's possible to rollover a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, but when you do this, any money that hasn't been taxed will be taxed as income.

This means you can't move your 401k into a traditional IRA and then into a Roth IRA in one swoop because then you technically made 1 million dollars in a year, and that's a lot of tax.

## Roth IRAs

### Contributions

You make contributions with your taxed income. If you make too much, you can't make contributions: partially for 122k-137k and completely for 137k+. The cap is $6,000 across all IRA accounts. 

You can, however, do a backdoor Roth IRA. You contribute to a traditional IRA, and then convert it to a Roth IRA. This also has the benefit of converting earnings in a traditional IRA into contributions of a Roth IRA, which allows you to withdraw it without penalty or tax 5 years later. See the [Roth IRA Conversion Ladder](#the-roth-ira-conversion-ladder).

You can also contribute by converting a traditional IRA, but you won't be able to withdraw it until after 5 years.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. And you get to choose index funds / ETFs (US and international) and bonds, so it's better than a 401k where you might not get to choose.

### Withdrawals

You can take out contributions once any Roth IRA reaches 5 years old, and you can withdraw contributions and earnings after 59.5 years.

If you convert a 401k or traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, what was previously earnings is now contributions to your Roth IRA, and you can pull it out; however, you must wait 5 years before pulling it out, and you must pay income tax for the conversion.  See the [Roth IRA Conversion Ladder](#the-roth-ira-conversion-ladder)

## The Roth IRA Conversion Ladder

Usually, early retirement involves not working, so you probably want a traditional IRA over Roth. There's other factors to consider like how much you want in retirement and how much you make now. It's possible you can't even contribute to a Roth IRA or get deductions on the traditional IRA.

Once you have 25 times what your desired salary is, you can begin laddering (or you should start 5 years before). 

1. You quit your job and convert your 401k into a traditional IRA. No taxes get taken out at this point.
1. The year you quit your job, move your salary amount over to your Roth IRA. You'll repeat this every year until 5 years before retirement.
1. You now survive for 5 years without funding (liquidate your taxed stocks, Roth IRA contributions or use your savings). This part requires planning.
1. After 5 years is up, you can now pull the initial conversion from your Roth IRA. The next year, you'll do the same for the second conversion. This is repeated until you're in retirement age.

## Traditional IRA or Roth IRA?

Do you want to pay taxes now or later? It depends, are your taxes higher now or later? If you earn 60k but then retire and can pull 100k, then a roth can help you stay in a lower tax bracket. Retirement money from 401k and IRA are income taxed, so pulling from a Roth IRA can put you in a lower tax bracket.

The benefit of Traditional IRAs come from wanting a larger income when you are retirement ready. If you are working and you pull from an IRA (or convert and then pull), then you lose a lot of money from income tax. If you aren't working, then you save more money.

You can also convert traditional IRAs over little by little to enable pulling large amounts out later without taxes, but the exact math should be worked out if you do this.

## FAQ

**What if I want to keep working after retirement?** Then the conversions will be expensive. Invest in Roth IRA.

**What if I want to increase my income with retirement before early retirement?** You can use this method, but with smaller amounts.

**When if I don't want kids and can live a peaceful really early retired life?** IRA is the way to go. When you retire, do the retirement Roth IRA ladder.

## Buying a House With Retirement Funds

You can buy a house using funds from your retirement account. 

* 401k
  * You can take out half your account up to 50k, and it gets taxed as income. But you have to pay it back or get fined.
  * You have to pay it back before you quit or get fired. Otherwise, it gets complicated.
* Traditional IRA
  * You can withdraw $10k, but you have to pay income tax on it. 
* Roth IRA
  * No special rules, but you can take out contributions

## Some History

You used to get social security and a pension from your employer. The government being poor and the corporations being corporations found a way to deny you that invented 401ks and made the employers do their own retirement funding. Because people have better things to do with their lives, they left the investing up to wall street. At the time, they did active trading believing it out performed index funds. They changed 2% fees, and people's 401ks never grew. These 2% fees are called expense ratios: ratio of profit we have to expense to the wall street people for investing for us. Not only that, but with dot com, 2008, and people focusing on retirement way too late in life, they're now going to have to work forever. Index funds are better for two reasons: they ride the market as a whole (meaning they out perform nearly all active traders) and they have lower expense ratios (meaning those profits actually go to you). I'm guessing that because 401ks are too restrictive, they made IRAs, and later Roth IRAs, but I don't actually know anything about the history of IRAs.
