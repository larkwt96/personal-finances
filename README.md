# Everything I Know About Finances

Somehow money is made, and this is called income. There are costs to living, and these are called expenses. You control many aspects of what income and expenses you have, but the goal is to maximize money flow (income minus expenses). If money flow is positive, then you are making money. With this extra money, you can create more income.

Keep your extra money in high interest accounts . At first, this is savings. It's possible to get a high interest [savings account](#saving) (e.g. with Ally Bank). Then you can pay down [loans or invest](#stocks) in the retirement fund or taxed stock accounts (e.g. with Vanguard). You should track your [accounts](#accounts) and set a budget (e.g. with Mint). Use [credit cards](#credit-cards) to make daily purchases to build credit and earn rewards with every purchase. Pay them off in full with your checking account (auto payments are nice).

## Types of Income and Expenses

These are the ways you can get and spend money.

* Income (+)
  * Paycheck / Salary 
  * Windfall (lottery, inheritance)
  * Assets (property, company, investments)
* Expenses (-)
  * Rent / Mortgage
  * Auto loan
  * Student loans
  * Credit card loans
  * Personal loans
  * Large purchases (trips, computers)

## Accounts

These are the places to store your money. Some earn you more money than others.

* Checking account
* Savings account
* Credit cards
* Stock accounts
  * Roth IRA
  * 401k
  * ETFs / Index Funds

## Basic Flow (#accounts)

Money originates from your income. It flows into your checking account. From there, expenses are paid. Extra funds are moved to your savings. When your savings account large enough, extra funds are moved to investments such as your retirement fund (Roth IRA, 401k) and finally ETFs or index funds or loans.

The flow of money will transfer between these accounts. When one is full, it moves to the next account. Savings have a self imposed cap, retirement funds have a cap, and stocks have no cap.

Part of your expenses is paying off loans, but if the interest rate of the market is greater than the interest rate of your loan, then it could be more beneficial to invest instead of paying off loans. See the Guide to Investing section.

Owning property or businesses can also be very profitable, but they take much more work and funding.

# Guide to Checking and Savings (#saving)

## Emergency Fund

Calculate the average monthly expenditure (including yearly expenses divided by 12). It's best to keep 6-12 months worth of this amount in liquid assets. This helps withstand a loss of income for that period of time. Liquid assets are assets which can be turned into cash very easily, such as cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money markets. Stocks, CDs, cars, properties and bonds are not easily accessible assets, and that's why they don't make good emergency funds.

## Management

For example, 2 months worth can be kept in checking and 8 months worth in savings. The amount in your checking account will rise with your income and decrease with your expenses, so there will always be 1-2 months worth. There will always be a 1 month buffer to prevent overdraft, keep minimum balance, and keep immediately ready funds.

If the checking account goes over the 2 month amount, the extra money should go into your savings account. When your savings account reaches 8 months worth, the extra money should go towards retirement and stocks.

## Large Purchases

If you are saving for something (down payment on house, laptop, etc), keep the money in your savings to take advantage of higher interest rates, and move it to checking when you make the purchase. Also, try to make the purchase with a credit card if possible.

## Interest 

Get high yield savings accounts to maximize your interest. Currently, interest rates can be around 2% which can yield several hundred dollars per year.

I recommend Ally Bank
* High yield savings account 
* Free checking with high interest
* No minimum balance
* Free checks and debit cards
* ACH transfers are free

# Guide to Credit Cards (#credit-cards)

Credit cards do two things: build credit and give rewards for daily expenses. If paid in full each month, you'll never pay interest. For that reason, use the credit card for everything, and never use your debit card or cash.

Make sure
* the signing bonus and reward is good
* $0 annual fee (or convert it before it becomes costly)
* interest is only applied to unpaid principle (if paid in full, no interest is ever applied)

## Credit Score

I'm no expert, but here's what I do know.

Multiple lines of credit are valued, and cards have signing bonuses. When your credit score is high enough from your first credit card to get good reward cards, apply for new credit cards, get the signing bonus, and then leave them open forever. If they aren't $0 annual fee cards, then convert them to fee less cards if you can. Repeat this 3 or 4 times (do more research if you want to continue doing this further).

* Good
  * Many lines of credit
  * Old lines of credit
* Bad
  * Missing payments
  * Lots credit inquiries
  * Closing credit lines

Opening too many accounts within a short period of time (2 months) can cause a lot of inquires and looks bad. However, 3-4 inquiries spaced out in a year is fine. This also reduces your average credit age, so once you have enough cards, you don't need more.

Closing credit cards is bad too. Instead, you can try to convert the card to a $0 annual fee card. This keeps the credit line open and doesn't hurt you. However, closing the account doesn't influence your score after two years, so if you have to close a credit card account, don't apply for auto or mortgage loans within those two years.

## Rewards

I've noticed 4 types of cards, generally.
* 1.5% cash back
  * Good card to get first (or second after building credit) 
* 1% cash back but 2-3% cash back on food, gas, travel
  * Optimally, use this card only on the 2-3% cash back items, and the 1.% percent cash back on the rest.
* Reward miles
  * Good with frequent travel and if you care about the luxury benefits
  * Usually has annual fee but much higher rewards
* 5% cash back on food, gas, travel but during limited times
  * I'm pretty sure these are for families with high expenses

# Guide to Investing (#stocks)

Main tips:
* Pay monthly loans
* Prioritize high interest
  * Pay credit card loans immediately
  * Invest when market growth rates are higher than loan rates
* Prioritize retirement funds over general market investments
* Use Vanguard for stocks

## Compound Interest Explained

It's import to understand compound interest, and there's tons of guides online. What's important to understand is that the amount doesn't matter as much as the rate does.
* After enough time, $50 growing at 5% interest will be more than $5000 growing at 1% since it grows 5 times faster.
* The same is true for debt interests. Given two loans, $50 at 10% and $5000 at 5%, it's cheaper to pay off the $50 loan first since it's growing twice as fast.
* The same is true for mixed interest. Suppose you have a student loan debt growing at 5%, but investing in the market might yield 6%. It's financially optimal (ignoring risk) to invest in the market instead of paying down your loan with extra cash (you should always pay your monthly payment)
* Credit card rates are extremely high. It's a really bad idea to let these types of debts sit and should be made a priority to pay off.

## Where Should Extra Money Go?

Any time you have extra money, you have to consider where to put it.
* Savings account (2%)
  * Your emergency fund should live here. You can get high yield accounts that have interest rates of 2% while still being able to access the money.
* Loans (~ -5%)
  * Always make the monthly payments so that you stay on track to becoming debt free
  * Mortgages, auto and student loans have rates where it might be better to invest your extra money instead of paying down the loans. It's riskier due to market volatility, and it's generally bad to have debt, so weigh your options. 
  * Generally, you want to pay off car loans in 1-2 years, mortgages in 15-30 years, and student loans in 10 years.
* Credit card debt (~ -15%)
  * Pay your card in full.
  * If you really need to, open a new card with 0% apr for a year. Then, make a large purchase. This is a way to get a 0% interest rate loan.
* Stocks

## Stocks 

* Roth IRA (~10%)
  * Tax free investing until your 59.5
  * There's a limit to how much you can put in this account
  * You put taxed income into this account
  * You can only pull out what you put in (but not what you've earned from interest)
  * When your 59.5, you can pull funds out without penalty
* 401k (~10%)
  * Look for an employer matching fund
  * Employers put part of income in here so you get taxed less
  * Tax free investing until your 59.5
  * Money is taxed when you pull it out
* ETFs / Index Funds / Bonds (~7%)
  * There's management fees and gains are taxed
  * There's no limit and you can sell any time
  * You want some ratio of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. 70 / 20 / 10 might be good
* Certificate of Deposit (2.5%)
  * You can't use the money you put in one of these. They are like short term investments, or bonds. Usually, you put some of your savings in one of these.
  * If you have loans, you should just pay those off since the interest rates of loans are often higher than CDs
  * Otherwise, this is a good place to put money when you have a specific time you know you'll need it. For example, if you're saving up for something.
