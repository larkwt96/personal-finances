# Everything I Know About Personal Finances

Money you make is income, and money you spend are expenses. The goal is to maximize how much you save, and with this extra money, you can create more income.

First, you build a savings, and it's possible to get a high interest [savings account](#guide-to-checking-and-savings) (e.g. with Ally Bank). This keeps your money safer from inflation. You should track your [accounts](#basic-flow) and set a budget (e.g. with Mint). Use [credit cards](#guide-to-credit-cards) to make daily purchases to build credit and earn rewards with every purchase. Pay them off in full with your checking account (auto payments are helpful).

Then with extra funds, you can pay down loans or [invest](#guide-to-investing) in the [retirement fund](#guide-to-retirement) or taxed stock accounts (e.g. with Vanguard). If your employer matches contributions to your 401k, max that; it's free money. Then, max your Traditional IRA or your Roth IRA (you can only contribute $6k per year). Then, max the rest of your 401k (up to $19k a year). After that, invest in normal investment accounts. Within all the accounts, invest in US and international index funds / ETFs and bonds.

Depending on your income and expenses, you'll eventually have enough to live off your retirement fund alone. The general rule is have 25 times what you want your salary to be. That's because you will pull out 4% of your retirement assets every year, and they will grow back by the end. There are ways of getting retirement funds out before 59.5 if you can retire early.

## Types of Income and Expenses

These are the ways you can get and spend money.

* Income (+)
  * Paycheck / Salary 
  * Windfalls (lottery, inheritance)
  * Property
  * Company
  * Investments
* Expenses (-)
  * Rent / Mortgage
  * Auto loan
  * Student loans
  * Credit card loans
  * Personal loans
  * Large purchases (trips, computers)
  * Kids

## Accounts

These are the places to store your money. Some earn you more money than others.

* Checking account
* Savings account
* Credit cards
* Stock accounts
  * Traditional or Roth IRA
  * 401k
  * Taxed accounts

## Basic Flow

Money originates from your income. It flows into your checking account. From there, expenses are paid. Extra funds are moved to your savings. When your savings account has enough emergency money, extra funds are moved to investments such as your retirement fund (Roth IRA, 401k) and finally ETFs or index funds or loans.

The flow of money will transfer between these accounts. When one is full, it moves to the next account. Savings have a self imposed cap, retirement funds have a legal cap, and taxed investments have no cap.

Part of your expenses is paying off loans, but if the interest rate of the market is greater than the interest rate of your loan, then it could be more beneficial to invest instead of paying off loans. See the [Guide to Investing section](#guide-to-investing).

Owning property or businesses can also be very profitable, but they take much more work and funding.

# Guide to Checking and Savings

## Emergency Fund

Calculate the average monthly expenditure (including yearly expenses divided by 12). It's best to keep 3-12 months worth of this amount in liquid assets. Liquid assets are assets which can be turned into cash very easily, such as cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, and money markets. This helps withstand a loss of income for that period of time. To have an emergency fund for health costs, get an HSA. Stocks, CDs, cars, properties and bonds are not easily accessible assets, and that's why they don't make good emergency funds.

## Management

For example, 2 months worth can be kept in checking and 6 months worth in savings. The amount in your checking account will rise with your income and decrease with your expenses, so there will always be 1-2 months worth. There will always be a 1 month buffer to prevent overdraft, keep minimum balance, and keep immediately ready funds.

If the checking account goes over the 2 month amount, the extra money should go into your savings account. When your savings account reaches 6 months worth, the extra money should go towards retirement and stocks.

## Large Purchases

If you are saving for something (down payment on house, laptop, etc), keep the money in your savings to take advantage of higher interest rates, and move it to checking when you make the purchase. Also, try to make the purchase with a credit card if possible.

## Interest 

Get high yield savings accounts to maximize your interest. Currently, interest rates can be around 2% which can yield a couple hundred dollars per year.

I recommend Ally Bank
* High yield savings account 
* Free checking with high interest
* No minimum balance
* Free checks and debit cards
* ACH transfers are free

# Guide to Credit Cards

Credit cards do two things: build credit and give rewards for daily expenses. If paid in full each month, you'll never pay interest. For that reason, use the credit card for everything, and never use your debit card or cash.

Make sure the card you get has
* the signing bonus and reward is good
* $0 annual fee (or convert it before it becomes costly)
* interest is only applied to unpaid principle (if paid in full, no interest is ever applied)

The number one rule is to pay them off as soon as possible. Interest rates are ridiculously high.

## Credit Score

Multiple lines of credit are valued, and cards have signing bonuses. When your credit score is high enough (670+) to get good reward cards, apply for new credit cards, get the signing bonus, and then leave them open forever. This is a really good way to boost your credit score.

If they aren't $0 annual fee cards, then downgrade them to no annual fee cards if you can; otherwise, close them as soon as possible. Repeat this 3 or 4 times, and watch your credit score dip a tiny bit and then sky rocket. If you want to continue doing this for the free money, do more research; it's called credit card churning (reddit is very helpful here).

* Good
  * Many lines of credit
  * Old lines of credit
  * Low credit utilization (stay below 30%)
* Bad
  * Missing payments
  * Lots credit inquiries
  * Closing credit lines

Opening too many accounts within a short period of time (2 months) can cause a lot of inquires and looks bad. However, 3-4 inquiries spaced out over a year is fine since they disappear quick. That's why it's ok to open so many credit cards.

Closing credit cards is bad too. Instead, you can try to downgrade the card to a $0 annual fee card. This keeps the credit line open and doesn't hurt you. However, closing the account doesn't influence your score after two years, so if you have to close a credit card account, don't apply for auto or mortgage loans within those two years. Don't close your oldest account.

## Rewards

I've noticed 4 types of cards, generally.
* 1.5% cash back
  * One of the best general rates
  * You don't have to think about which card to use
* 1% cash back but 2-3% cash back on food, gas, travel
  * Optimally, use this card only on the 2-3% cash back items, and the 1.% percent cash back on the rest.
* Reward miles
  * Good with frequent travel and if you care about the luxury benefits
  * Usually has annual fee but much higher rewards
  * You can close/downgrade the account before the first annual fee
* 5% cash back on food, gas, travel but during limited times
  * I'm pretty sure these are for families with high expenses

## Churning

Credit card churning is when you open lots of credit cards, get the rewards, and then close it. It's not great for your credit score, so it's generally not advised unless you absolutely know you're not taking out any loans (car, mortgage, personal) in the next two years. If you're credit score is above 800, then even then, it's probably fine. If you have really old lines of credit, be sure to close the accounts not downgrade them since leaving them open will lower your average age of credit lines. Finally, don't spend money you wouldn't have just to get the reward. That defeats the purpose.

## Recomendation

I'm no expert, but here's what I know.

Open a credit card to build credit. Once your credit score's high enough to get good reward cards, get 3-5 more. If you want, go up to 10 cards, but only do this if you don't plan on applying for car or mortgage loans within 1-2 years. The credit score dents are small and don't stay very long.

# Guide to Investing

By investing, I mean paying off loans, buying bonds, CDs, investing in stocks, investing in stocks through retirement funds, etc. There's also buying businesses and real estate, but that's not as easy. This is where your extra money starts to generate more money

Main tips:
* Pay monthly loans so that they're paid off in time.
* Prioritize high interest
  * Max your employer's 401k matching plan (if applicable) (50-100%)
  * Pay credit card loans immediately (10-27%)
  * Invest when market growth rates (5-8%) are higher than loan rates (4-12%)
* Prioritize retirement funds over general market investments since they are untaxed in several ways.
* Invest in ETFs or index mutual funds
* Make sure the expense ratio is low

## Compound Interest Explained

It's import to understand compound interest, and there's tons of guides online. What's important to understand is that the amount doesn't matter as much as the rate does.
* After enough time, $50 growing at 5% interest will be more than $5000 growing at 1% since it grows 5 times faster.
* The same is true for debt interests. Given two loans, $50 at 10% and $5000 at 5%, it's cheaper to pay off the $50 loan first since it's growing twice as fast.
* The same is true for mixed interest. Suppose you have a student loan debt growing at 4.5%, but investing in the market might yield 5.5%. It's financially optimal to invest in the market instead of paying down your loan with extra cash 
* If you fail to pay off your loan in time because you payed minimums and invested instead of making monthly payments, then the fees associated with not paying off a loan are higher than the compound growth from investing. Compound interest isn't magic, and it takes 20+ years. It's less risky to pay off loans, so there's a balance.
* Credit card rates are extremely high. It's a really bad idea to let these types of debts sit and should be made a priority to pay off.

## Extra Fund Allocation

Any time you have extra money, you have to consider where to put it.
* Savings account (2%)
  * Your emergency fund should live here. You can get high yield accounts that have interest rates of 2% while still being able to access the money.
  * This is a good way to fight inflation (2-3%)
* Loans (~ -5%)
  * Always make the monthly payments so that you stay on track to becoming debt free
  * Mortgages, auto and student loans have rates where it might be better to invest your extra money instead of paying down the loans. It's riskier due to market volatility, and it's generally bad to have debt, so weigh your options. In the long run, it is better.
  * Generally, you want to pay off car loans in 1-2 years because of the high rates; mortgages in 15-30 years, and student loans in 10 years.
* Credit card debt (~ -15%)
  * Pay your card in full.
  * If you really need to, open a new card with 0% apr for a year. Then, make a large purchase. This is a way to get a 0% interest rate loan, but you only have 6-18 months, and it's scary.
* Invest in stocks through your retirement fund followed by taxed accounts.

## Investment Options (in order of priority)

* Accounts 
  * 401k Matching cap (50-100% if offered by employer)
  * Traditional / Roth IRA cap (7-8% but can only deposit $6k/yr)
  * The rest of your 401k cap (6-8% if employer offers a good plan)
  * HSA account (6-8%, but there's a ~$7k total cap to the account)
  * Taxable investment accounts (5-6%)
* Investment Options
  * index ETFs / index mutual funds / Bonds (~5-6%)
  * There's expense ratio fees
  * You want some ratio of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds. 70 / 20 / 10 might be good, but it also can vary with age and which account.
* Certificate of Deposit (2.5%)
  * You can't use the money you put in one of these. They are like short term investments, or bonds
  * If you have loans, you should just pay those off since the interest rates of loans are often higher than CDs
  * This is a good place to put money when you have a specific time you know you'll need it. For example, if you're saving up for something or if you're feeling risky with your emergency fund.

# Guide to Retirement

To maximize your money, you want to invest. When you get an income (usually from a job) it's taxed. Then, when you invest and your money grows, it's taxed again. Retirement funds are ways of avoiding or deferring the taxes. All earnings on retirement investments are not taxed. For more details, see below: [401k](#401k), [Tradition IRA](#traditional-ira), [Roth IRA](#roth-ira).

Here are the main accounts:
* Roth IRA
  * Your income is taxed, so contributions have already been taxed. Since contributions have already been taxed, withdrawals are not taxed.
  * You can also withdraw contributions before 60 untaxed
  * If you make too much, you can't contribute to a Roth IRA
* Traditional IRA
  * Contributions are tax deductible (equivalent of untaxed), but that means withdrawals are taxed.
  * If you make too much you might not qualify for the deduction, but that also means contributions have already been taxed, so withdrawals aren't. It's possible to have to pay taxes for some of the withdrawal: Google pro rata.
* 401k
  * Contributions are taken before income tax, but can only come from job income with an employers plan.
  * Employer may match up to some portion of what you can deposit. This is the best investment, so max this out always (apparently even above credit card debt).
  * Withdrawals are taxed since you haven't paid taxes on the money yet.

IRAs are typically better since you have more control. 401ks are employer sponsored. If they have a matching fund, max that out. Otherwise, contribute as much as possible to either Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. [Which one?](#traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira) Just go with a Roth IRA unless you have an [early retirement plan](#early-retirement). Then, once you've met the IRA cap (the cap applies to any IRA regardless of type), then contribute the rest to your 401k. That cap is higher, but once you reach it, then you can contribute the rest to taxed investment accounts. There's no cap here, so all extra savings go to this account.

## Early Retirement

It's possible to get funds out of retirement well before 60 using a [Roth IRA Conversion Ladder](#roth-ira-conversion-ladder). See reddit's r/fire community. Basically, save a ton into traditional IRAs and 401ks, and then convert them to Roth IRAs where you can pull the funds out 5 years later (even before turning 60). The more planning and frugality, the sooner you can retire and the more you can retire with.

## Tips

* Order of investing importance:
  * Employer 401k matching
  * IRA
  * 401k
  * Taxed investments
* You can pull money out before 60 by building a Roth IRA ladder.
* There are caps to the amount you can invest, which is why you can't just excessively invest when you're 35 and catch up. Also, the amount it could have grown in that 10 years is a lot (it could have doubled.)
* 4% rule: if you withdraw 4% of your retirement fund, you can earn it back by the end of the year. 96% of the time, this is sustainable. Therefore, to retire, you need 25 times (1 / 4%) the amount you plan to spend per year in your retirement fund. 30k per year needs 750k.

## 401k

### Contributing

This has to be setup with your employer because it gets siphoned out of your income before taxes. There is a percentage you can contribute up to 19,000. Your employer may also match part of this percentage.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. These can have fees or not be as good as IRAs, so typically, they are not as good without an employer matching.

### Withdrawals

Because you haven't paid taxes on the money in this account, income tax will be applied when you withdraw from this account at any point. If you withdraw before 59.5, then there is additionally a 10% tax fee.

It also means if you continue working, you end up in a really high tax bracket, but at that point, you shouldn't be pulling money out because what do you even need it for?

### Rollovers

You can roll a 401k over into a traditional IRA without paying taxes. This is probably optimal after changing employers unless the new 401k is somehow better.

## Traditional IRA

### Contributions

You can use contributions as a tax deduction. This is different from contributing before being taxed, but it's ultimately the same. However, the tax deductible isn't possible if you make too much: partially for 64k-74k per year and completely for 74k+. I think at that point, it's basically a Roth IRA or you should just invest in a Roth IRA. There is a $6,000 cap which is why it's important to invest early. Further, this cap is for all IRA accounts, so you can't cap an IRA and then go contribute to a Roth IRA.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. And you get to choose index funds / ETFs (US and international) and bonds, so it's better than a 401k where you might not get to choose.

### Withdrawals

Because you haven't paid taxes on the money in this account, income tax will be applied when you withdraw from this account at any point. If you withdraw before 59.5, then there is additionally a 10% tax fee.

It also means if you continue working, you end up in a really high tax bracket, but at that point, you shouldn't be pulling money out because what do you even need it for?

Yes I copied this from 401k.

### Rollovers

It's possible to rollover a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, but when you do this, any money that hasn't been taxed will be taxed as income.

This means you can't move your 401k into a traditional IRA and then into a Roth IRA in one swoop because then you technically made 1 million dollars in a year, and that's a lot to tax as income. On the plus side, you can pull that now $665,000 out 5 years later. However, a laddering technique would be significantly more cost effective.

## Roth IRA

### Contributions

You make contributions with your taxed income. If you make too much, you can't make contributions: partially for 122k-137k and completely for 137k+. The cap is $6,000 across all IRA accounts. 

You can, however, do a backdoor Roth IRA. You contribute to a traditional IRA, and then convert it to a Roth IRA. This also has the benefit of converting earnings in a traditional IRA into contributions of a Roth IRA, which allows you to withdraw it without penalty or tax 5 years later. See the [Roth IRA Conversion Ladder](#the-roth-ira-conversion-ladder).

You can also contribute by converting a traditional IRA, but you won't be able to withdraw it until after 5 years.

### Growth

Like all retirement accounts, earnings are tax free. And you get to choose index ETFs / index mutual funds, both US and international, and bonds, so it's better than a 401k where you might not get to choose.

### Withdrawals

You can take out contributions once any Roth IRA reaches 5 years old, and you can withdraw contributions and earnings after 59.5 years.

If you convert a 401k or traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, what was previously earnings is now contributions to your Roth IRA, and you can pull it out; however, you must wait 5 years before pulling it out, and you must pay income tax for the conversion. See the [Roth IRA Conversion Ladder](#the-roth-ira-conversion-ladder).

## The Roth IRA Conversion Ladder

Usually, early retirement involves not working, so you probably want a traditional IRA over Roth. There's other factors to consider like how much you want in retirement and how much you make now. It's possible you can't even contribute to a Roth IRA or get deductions on the traditional IRA.

Once you have 25 times what your desired salary is, you can begin laddering (or you can start 5 years before). 

1. You quit your job and convert your 401k into a traditional IRA. No taxes get taken out at this point.
1. The year you quit your job, move your salary amount over to your Roth IRA. You'll repeat this every year until 5 years before retirement.
1. You now survive for 5 years without funding (liquidate your taxed stocks, Roth IRA contributions or use your savings). This part requires planning.
1. After 5 years is up, you can now pull the initial conversion from your Roth IRA. The next year, you'll do the same for the second conversion. This is repeated until you're in retirement age.

If you actually do this, consult a tax specialist because it gets complicated.

## Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA

For Traditional IRAs you get taxed when you take it out. For Roth IRAs, you get taxed when you put it in. If you make too much, you can't get tax deductions on traditional IRAs, so you might as well just put it directly into the Roth IRA. If you make way too much money, then you have to put it in a traditional IRA, and convert it over to a Roth IRA.

If you retire early, then you have no income, and you're in a much lower tax bracket, so it's better to tax it then (Traditional IRA is best). If you have a large income later, then you lose a lot of earnings to taxes, but you also don't need to pull out as much if any, so it's up in the air which is better, but you probably want the Roth. That way, you can pull out a lot of money all at once for bigger investments like housing or businesses or kids college tuition (which has it's own investment account, 527 or something like that).

Basically, the Roth sacrifices a little bit of earnings (100k relative to 3 million) for the ease and convenience of pulling large amounts out (either for large late life purchases or high retirement salaries possibly in addition to existing salaries).

## FAQ

**What if I want to keep working after retirement?** Then the conversions will be expensive. Invest in Roth IRA.

**What if I want to increase my income with retirement funds before early retirement?** You can use the ladder method or pull from your Roth IRA contributions, but with smaller amounts.

**When if I don't want kids and can live a peaceful really early retired life?** Traditional IRA is the way to go. When you retire, do the retirement Roth IRA ladder.

## Buying a House With Retirement Funds

You can buy a house using funds from your retirement account. 

* 401k
  * You can take out half your account up to 50k, and it gets taxed as income. But you have to pay it back or get fined.
  * You have to pay it back before you quit or get fired. Otherwise, it gets complicated.
* Traditional IRA
  * You can withdraw $10k, but you have to pay income tax on it. 
* Roth IRA
  * No special rules, but you can take out contributions

## Some History

You used to get social security and a pension from your employer. People live way longer than before, so social security's probably gone. The corporations being corporations found a way to deny you pension and made the employers do their own retirement investing. Because people have better things to do with their lives, they left the investing up to wall street mutual funds. At the time, they did active trading believing it out performed market indexes. They changed 2% fees, and people's 401ks never grew. These 2% fees are called expense ratios: ratio of profit we have to expense to the wall street people for investing for us. Not only that, but with dot com, 2008, and people focusing on retirement way too late in life, these unlucky individuals now have to work forever. Now, we have index tracking mutual funds which are better for two reasons: they ride the market as a whole (meaning they out perform nearly all active traders) and they have lower expense ratios (meaning those profits actually go to you). I'm guessing that because 401ks are too restrictive, they made IRAs, and later Roth IRAs, but I don't actually know anything about the history of IRAs. Even further, we now have index tracking ETFs which are like index mutual funds but they can be traded during the day (among other differences). I think these are generally recommended now.
